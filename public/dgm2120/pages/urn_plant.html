        <h1>Aechmea fasciata</h1>
        <div class=text-block>
            <p>AKA: Urn Plant, Silver Vase </p>
            <p>4 to 5 years to mature to bloom</p>
            <p> Epiphytic - Grow on other plants</p>

            <h3 id='description'>Description</h3>
            <p>The Silver Vase plant looks similar to other bromeliads, espeically it's more common cousin, Guzmania, with the exception of the leaf texture: the leaves have a dusty, scaley surface in horizontal stripes which helps the bromeliad bring in water through its leaves. The inflorescence, or flower-like middle, is a pretty light to hot pink color and lasts for months. When the actual flowers bloom, they are a bright violet color and are more short-lived.</p>
            <p>The plant is very top heavy. They do much better in more sturdy or heavy containers.</p>

            <h3 id='origin'>Oirigin</h3>
            <p>South Eastern Brazil</p>
            <p>Grows either in trees or the ground</p>

            <h3 id='size'>Size</h3>
            <p>Up to about 18 inches tall and 26 inches wide</p>

            <h3 id='temp'>Temperature</h3>
            <p>65-75°F (18-24°C) or average room temperature. A highter temperature encourages blooming</p>

            <h3 id='sun'>Sunlight</h3>
            <p>Bright, indirect light</p>
            <p>East and West facing window sills or near South facing windows as long as it doesn't get direct sun. The leaves will scorch in sunlight that's too hot and direct.</p>

            <h3 id='water'>Water</h3>
            <p>Keep urn filled with water. To reduce mineral build up rain, distilled or filtered water are best.</p>
            <p>Drain and rinse out urn once or twice a month.</p>
            <p>Potting medium can be watered once the top feels dry, but keeping the urn plant's feet wet can lead to root rot.</p>
            <p>Mist its leaves if air is dry, especially in summer.</p>
            <h3 id='humid'>Humidity</h3>
            <p>Like with the temperature, if you're comfortable with the humidity, the plant will also tolerate.  Though it would appreciate its leaves misted in drier climates, espeically in the summertime.</p>

            <h3 id='fert'>Fertilizer</h3>
            <p>Use bromeliad or orchid fertilizer anytime except winter months when the plant is 'resting'.</p>
            <p>Dilute the fertilizer if you fertilize more than twice a year.</p>

            <h3 id='soil'>Soil</h3>
            <p>Orchid soil can be used. The soil should drain very well.</p>
            <p>Regular potting soil mixed with pearlite and bark is also good.</p>

            <h3 id='propagation'>Propagation</h3>
            <p>While the a bromeliad is blooming or afterwards, it produces little clones of
                itself called 'pups'.  The 'mother' plant will never bloom again and will
                eventually wither and die. Once the pups have reached about 5 inches tall or
                look like they could survive by themsleves, they can be cut away from the mother
                plant. Take care while cutting though to minimize damage to the pup and the
                mother plant if you plan on keeping the latter any longer.</p>
            <p>Removing the pups from the mother plant is purely optional though.</p>

            <h3 id='issues'>Issues</h3>
            <ul class='no-deco'>
                <li>Dry, yellow or brown leaf tips - underwatered</li>
                <li>Dry, yellow or brown spots on leaves - too much hot or direct sunlight</li>
                <li>Scale and mealy bugs can be an issue</li>
                <li>The base of the plant turning black, mushy, or moldy - The plant has been over watered and is rotting</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id=''>Toxicity</h3>
            <p>Non-toxic to cats and dogs </p>
            <p>Skin irritation and/or allergies with skin contact</p>
