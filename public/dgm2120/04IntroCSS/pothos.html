            <h2 id='description'>Description</h2>
            <p>Golden pothos is a vining or creeping plant that originated from Moorea and has spread to many tropical and subtropical areas where it is considered an invasive weed. Since it grows quickly and tolerates very low light well, it is difficult to control and is therefore also called Devil's Ivy.  What makes it a weed in warmer climates is also what makes it such a great indoor house plant because it tolerates neglect and most environments.</p>
            <p>The leaves are heart shaped and depending on the cultivar, can have a marbled verification of green, yellow, and white. Roots will grow out of any section of the stems that touch soil or other growing mediums.</p>

            <h2 id='size'>Size</h2>
            <p>Individual stems can grow 30 feet (10 meters) or more if supported.</p>
            <p>If a more bushy and compact growth pattern is desired, long or leggy stems can be pruned.</p>
            <p>Cuttings can be placed back into the soil or used for propagation.</p>

            <h2 id='temp'>Temperature</h2>
            <p>65-75°F (18-24°C) or average room temperature. </p>

            <h2 id='sun'>Sunlight</h2>
            <p>Bright, indirect light</p>
            <p>Stays green in low light</p>

            <h2 id='water'>Water</h2>
            <p>Water when the top couple of inches of soil feel dry.</p>
            <p>The roots will rot if they are kept soggy.</p>

            <h2 id='humid'>Humidity</h2>
            <p>Tolerates a dry climate</p>

            <h2 id='fert'>Fertilizer</h2>
            <h2 id='soil'>Soil</h2>
            <p>Regular potting soil as long as it’s well-draining and water can drain out of the container.</p>
            <p>Pothos are very easy going and do well growing in soiless medium and water -- like draped over the edge of a fish tank.</p>

            <h2 id='propagation'>Propagation</h2>
            <p>Propagation is very easy. Just cut a stem and remove any of the bottom leaves that would be below water level and place into a container of water. Once roots sprout it can be transplanted into soil.</p>

            <h2 id='issues'>Issues</h2>
            <ul >
                <li>Wilting and dry soil - under watered</li>
                <li>Yellowing and wilting or dropping leaves - Over watered</li>
                <li>Stems turning black, mushy, or moldy - The plant has been over watered and is rotting</li>
                <li>Plant loses its variegation - Too little light. Giving the plant more light will allow new growth to have variegation but once variegation is lost old growth is unlikely to gain it back.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id='toxic'>Toxicity</h2>
            <p>- Toxic -</p>
            <p>Just keep it away from anyone who might try to eat it, otherwise they'll either need veterinary care or a call to poison control.</p>
