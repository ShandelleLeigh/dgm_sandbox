        <div class=text-block>
            <p>AKA: Urn Plant, Silver Vase </p>
            <p>4 to 5 years to mature to bloom</p>
            <p> <a href="terms.html#epiphyte"> Epiphytic </a></p>

            <h2 id='description'>Description</h2>
            <p>The Silver Vase plant looks similar to other bromeliads, especially it's more common cousin, Guzmania,
                with the exception of the leaf texture: the leaves have a dusty, scaly surface in horizontal stripes
                which helps the bromeliad bring in water through its leaves and acts as sunscreen. The inflorescence, or flower-like middle,
                is a pretty light to hot pink color and lasts for months. When the actual flowers bloom, they are a
                bright violet color and are more short-lived.</p>
            <p>The plant is very top heavy. They do much better in sturdy and heavy containers.</p>

            <h2 id='origin'>Origin</h2>
            <p>South Eastern Brazil</p>
            <p>Grows either in trees or the ground</p>

            <h2 id='size'>Size</h2>
            <p>Up to about 18 inches tall and 26 inches wide</p>

            <h2 id='temp'>Temperature</h2>
            <p>65-75°F (18-24°C) or average room temperature. A higher temperature encourages blooming</p>

            <h2 id='sun'>Sunlight</h2>
            <p>Bright, indirect light</p>
            <p>East and West facing window sills or near South facing windows as long as it doesn't get direct sun. The
                leaves will scorch in sunlight that's too hot and direct.</p>

            <h2 id='water'>Water</h2>
            <p>Keep urn filled with water. To reduce mineral build up rain, distilled or filtered water are best.</p>
            <p>Drain and rinse out urn once or twice a month.</p>
            <p>Potting medium can be watered once the top feels dry, but keeping the urn plant's feet wet can lead to
                root rot.</p>
            <p>Mist its leaves if air is dry, especially in summer.</p>
            <h2 id='humid'>Humidity</h2>
            <p>Like with the temperature, if you're comfortable with the humidity, the plant will also tolerate it. Though it would appreciate its leaves misted in drier climates, especially in the summertime.</p>

            <h2 id='fert'>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Use bromeliad or orchid fertilizer anytime except winter months when the plant is 'resting'.</p>
            <p>Dilute the fertilizer if you fertilize more than twice a year.</p>

            <h2 id='soil'>Soil</h2>
            <p>Orchid soil can be used. The soil should drain very well.</p>
            <p>Regular potting soil mixed with perlite and bark is also good.</p>

            <h2 id='propagation'>Propagation</h2>
            <p>Once a bromeliad starts blooming, it starts producing little clones of itself called 'pups'. The 'mother' plant will never bloom again and will eventually wither and die.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Wait until the pup has reached about 5 inches or taller. Once the pups have reached about 5 inches tall or look like they could survive by themselves, they can be cut away from the mother plant. Take care while cutting though to minimize damage to the pup and the mother plant if you plan on keeping the latter any longer.</li>
                <li>Careful to not damage either plant, disconnect the pup from the mother plant.  You can use a knife or gently pull the plants apart.</li>
                <li>The pup can be potted in orchid potting medium, wrapped in and made into a kokedama, etc.</li>
                <li>Fill the urn of the pup with filtered or distilled water.</li>
                <li>Enjoy new baby plant!</li>
            </ol>



            <p>Removing the pups from the mother plant is purely optional though.</p>

            <h2 id='issues'>Issues</h2>
            <ul class='no-deco'>
                <li>Dry, yellow or brown leaf tips - underwatered</li>
                <li>Dry, yellow or brown spots on leaves - too much hot or direct sunlight</li>
                <li>Scale and mealybugs can be an issue</li>
                <li>The base of the plant turning black, mushy, or moldy - The plant has been over watered and is
                    rotting</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id='toxic'>Toxicity</h2>
