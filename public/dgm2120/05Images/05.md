Image Gallery

- [x] For this assignment you will need to locate and download at least 8 images related to your web site subject. Open them in an image editor and crop and resize them all to similar sizes. I recommend that the image be no bigger than 200px tall or 200 px wide. If you have Photoshop please use that, if not, please download a cool free program called GIMP from www.gimp.org/. It works just like Photoshop.
